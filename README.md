# Gameboy-Camera-Filter-Max
The Gameboy Camera was a digital camera accessory for the original Gameboy. The black and white camera shot 112x180 pictures in 2-bit grayscale. In recent years the aesthetics of these cameras have been more and more popular. At least for me, the look of these photos have always draw my eye.

I have made a filter in Max to give any video or image the look of a photo from Gameboy Camera. This process uses jit.gl.pix and therefore needs a gl context to work properly. I have also added the ability to use color.
